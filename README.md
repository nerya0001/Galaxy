> A simple game made with kivi
> Made following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Imtec4ReQ&list=PLYK2IHq5SkUdvIukAog30Mfmu8SiQSVTp&index=4&t=8731s)   

Learned to use the KIVY library.

## How To Run

To run the game do the following:
1. download the repository and open it in an IDE.  
2. run the `main.py` file using the play button in the IDE or in the terminal with the command:  

```
python main.py
```   

if it doesn't work try:  

```
python3 main.py
```   
that should work.
